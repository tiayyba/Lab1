# Lab1
## Percentage in Final Grades: 2%

### Submission Details

In this lab you will create six simple scripts. Write the scripts in VsCode. Save the files as .py files and run the files from command line with python interpreter. The command line should show your unique username. The path to .py file should also clearly show your unique username. This is important, otherwise you will receive zero marks for the lab.  Take the screenshot of your script and command line.
Add this screenshot in a word document called SenecaUsernameLab1. Do this for all the six scripts.

Please note that you must complete the lab during the class hours and show your progress to the professor to receive the marks for the lab.
### Lab Objectives
- Create and execute simple python scripts which require creating and initializing variables, using string concatenation, print() function and simple arithmetic operations.

Lab1a.py
- Create a new folder in your home called PRG101Lab1.
- Create a new python file in this directory called lab1a.py
-	What should your script have?
    - The first three lines should be comments and display author name (you), name of the script (lab1a.py) and the description of the code.
    - Next, create a variable called message
    - Set the variable to equal to ‘Welcome to PRG101”
    - Print message
    - Use the builtin type() function and print the type of this variable.
- Add another print statement that uses the variable you just created and concatenate it with the statement “ Python is the future.”
- Open the terminal from vscode and run the following command to execute your program. 
    _python lab1a.py_
- The image below shows the process for a simple hello world program.

 

•	Take the screenshot of your script and the command line and add in the file SenecaUsernameLab1.doc
Lab1b.py
•	Create a python script (called lab1b.py) in the same directory
•	Requirements
o	The first three lines should be comments as you did for lab1a.py
o	The script should use a variable called "name"
o	The value of the "name" should be your name.
o	Use the string method .upper() to convert the name to upper case.
o	The script should have another variable called “age”
o	The value of “age” should be your age
o	The script, when executed, should print out "How are you yourname? Happy xxth birthday!" To print this output, concatenate the strings using + operator.
•	Take Screenshot of your script and command line and add in the file SenecaUsernameLab1.doc


Lab1c.py
•	Create a python script (called lab1c.py) in the same directory
•	Requirements
o	The first three lines should be comments as you did for lab1a.py
o	The script should use a variable called "num1"
o	The value of the "num1" should be "5"
o	The script should have another variable called “num2”
o	The value of “num2” should be 25
o	There should be another variable called “age”
o	The value of age is the total of num1 + num2
o	The script, when executed should print out “Isaac is 30 years old!” using the variables you created above. Use the + operator to concatenate the strings.
•	Take Screenshot of your script and command line and add in the file SenecaUsernameLab1.doc


Lab1d.py
•	Create a python script (called lab1d.py) in the same directory
•	Requirements
o	The first three lines should be comments as you did for lab1a.py
o	The script should use a variable called "x"
o	The value of the "x"  should be "5"
o	The script should have another variable called “y”
o	The value of “y” should be 5
o	There should be another variable called “z”
o	The value of “z” should be 10
o	The script, when executed, should print out "5 + 5 * 10 = 55" (the printout should change if the values in the variables change)
•	Take Screenshot of your script and command line and add in the file SenecaUsernameLab1.doc

Lab1e.py
•	Create a python script (called lab1e.py) in the same directory which writes a python expression for the following maths expression.
 
•	Create all the required variables and assign them values of your choice. 
•	Take Screenshot of your script and command line and add in the file SenecaUsernameLab1.doc


Lab1f.py
•	Create a python script (called lab1f.py) in the same directory which writes a python expression for the following maths expression.
 
•	Create all the required variables and assign them values of your choice.
•	Take Screenshot of your script and command line and add in the file SenecaUsernameLab1.doc
